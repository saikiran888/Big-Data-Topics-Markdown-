# Phases of Big Data analysis

### 1. Business Case/Problem Definition

- **In Simple Terms**: This phase is like identifying a puzzle to solve. It's about understanding what problem or opportunity we want to address using data analytics. Think of it as defining the question we're trying to answer with data.
- **Example**: A retail store wants to understand why sales are declining in certain regions. The problem is defined as "Identify the factors causing declining sales."

### 2. Data Identification

- **In Simple Terms**: Once we know our question, we need to find the pieces of the puzzle. This phase involves identifying the data sources we'll need to collect or access to solve our problem. It's like gathering all the necessary clues.
- **Example**: The store identifies data sources such as sales records, customer demographics, inventory levels, and external factors like local economic data.

## 3. Data Acquisition and Filtration

- **In Simple Terms**: Now that we know where the data is, we need to collect it. Think of this as going out and gathering all the pieces of the puzzle. We also need to filter out any irrelevant or duplicate data.
- **Example**: The store collects sales data for the past year but filters out incomplete or irrelevant records.

## 4. Data Extraction

- **In Simple Terms**: Extracting data is like taking the puzzle pieces and separating them from their original sources. It's getting the data ready to work with.
- **Example**: They extract sales data from different store locations and merge it into a single dataset for analysis.

## 5. Data Munging (Validation and Cleaning)

- **In Simple Terms**: Just as puzzle pieces might have dust or imperfections, data can have errors. Data munging is like cleaning and verifying the pieces to make sure they fit together properly.
- **Example**: They clean the data by removing duplicate entries, correcting errors, and ensuring all data is in a consistent format.

## 6. Data Aggregation & Representation (Storage)

- **In Simple Terms**: After cleaning, we group the puzzle pieces into sets. In the data world, this means storing and organizing the data in a way that's easy to work with.
- **Example**: The cleaned data is stored in a centralized database, making it easily accessible for analysis.

## 7. Exploratory Data Analysis

- **In Simple Terms**: This is like arranging the puzzle pieces on the table and studying them. We look for patterns, outliers, and interesting clues within the data.
- **Example**: Analysts examine the data to find patterns, like sales trends during different seasons or correlations between sales and promotional events.

## 8. Data Visualization (Preparation for Modeling and Assessment)

- **In Simple Terms**: To make sense of the puzzle, we might create a picture. Data visualization is like turning the puzzle pieces into a picture to help us understand the story they tell.
- **Example**: Visualizations, like line charts or heatmaps, are created to display the findings, making it easier for decision-makers to understand trends.

## 9. Utilization of Analysis Results

- **In Simple Terms**: Finally, we use the insights we've gained from the puzzle to make decisions. It's like solving the puzzle and using what we've learned to take action, whether it's in business, healthcare, or any other field.
- **Example**: The store uses the insights gained, such as identifying the impact of specific promotions on sales, to make informed decisions on marketing strategies and inventory management.
